# CZSH - Standalone Zsh Configuration

This project sets up a customized Zsh environment with various plugins and tools to enhance your terminal experience. **This configuration does NOT require Oh My Zsh** - all plugins are installed and managed directly for better performance and reduced overhead.

## Features

- üöÄ **No Oh My Zsh dependency** - Lightweight and fast
- üé® **Powerlevel10k theme** - Beautiful and highly customizable prompt
- üîç **Smart plugin management** - Direct plugin loading without framework overhead
- üì¶ **Essential plugins included** - Auto-suggestions, syntax highlighting, completions, and more
- üõ†Ô∏è **Modern tools integration** - fzf, lazydocker, marker, todo.sh, Neovim with NvChad

## Supported Operating Systems

- **Linux**: Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Fedora, CentOS, and other major distributions
- **macOS**: Intel and Apple Silicon Macs with automatic Homebrew installation

## Prerequisites

### Linux
- Git
- Python3
- wget or curl
- fontconfig (for font management)

### macOS  
- Git (usually pre-installed or via Xcode Command Line Tools)
- Python3 (usually pre-installed or via Homebrew)
- wget or curl (curl is pre-installed, wget will be installed via Homebrew if needed)
- Homebrew (will be automatically installed if not present)

## Installation

To install the project, run the `install.sh` script:

```sh
./install.sh
```

### Command Line Options

- `--cp-hist` or `-c`: Copy bash history to zsh history
- `--interactive` or `-n`: Run in interactive mode (prompts for shell change)
- `--codex` or `-x`: Enable zsh-codex with OpenAI integration

Example:
```sh
./install.sh --cp-hist --codex
```
This script will:

- Install and configure zsh plugins directly (no Oh My Zsh needed)
- Install fzf for fuzzy finding
- Install powerlevel10k theme (standalone version)
- Install lazydocker for managing Docker containers
- Install marker for command bookmarking
- Install todo.sh for managing todo lists
- Install Neovim with NvChad configuration

## Configuration

### Zsh Plugins
The following Zsh plugins are configured and loaded directly:

- **zsh-autosuggestions** - Fish-like autosuggestions
- **zsh-syntax-highlighting** - Real-time syntax highlighting
- **zsh-completions** - Additional completion definitions
- **zsh-history-substring-search** - Search history with arrow keys
- **fzf-tab** - Fuzzy completion with fzf
- **forgit** - Interactive git commands
- **z** - Smart directory jumping
- **zsh-codex** - AI-powered command completion (optional)

### Built-in Functionality
The configuration includes replacements for common Oh My Zsh plugins:

- **Web search** - Search engines directly from terminal
- **Extract** - Universal archive extraction function
- **Docker aliases** - Common docker command shortcuts
- **Git aliases** - Useful git shortcuts and functions

### Custom Zsh Configuration
Place your personal Zsh configuration files under:
```
~/.config/czsh/zshrc/
```

All files in this directory will be automatically sourced.

## Plugin Management

The configuration uses a lightweight plugin management system that:

- Loads plugins directly without framework overhead
- Automatically handles different plugin file naming conventions
- Provides better performance than Oh My Zsh
- Maintains compatibility with most zsh plugins

## OpenAI API Key
To configure the OpenAI API key for zsh-codex, the script will prompt you to enter your API key. This key will be stored in:
```
~/.config/zsh_codex.ini
```

## Usage
After installation, start a new Zsh session to apply the changes. Make sure to change Zsh to the default shell by running:

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

In a new Zsh session, manually run:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Migration from Oh My Zsh

If you're migrating from Oh My Zsh, this configuration provides:

- **Better performance** - No framework overhead
- **Same functionality** - All popular plugins work the same way
- **Easier customization** - Direct plugin management
- **Reduced complexity** - No need to understand Oh My Zsh internals

Your existing plugin configurations should work with minimal changes.
